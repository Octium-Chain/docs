# OCT Chain Documentations

Welcome to the OCT Chain documentation site!

Please note that both the OCT Chain software and this documentation site will improve over time and is still a work-in-progress.<br/>
Be sure to engage with our community channels to stay updated.

Have fun trading and see you on chain!

## What is OCT Chain?

OCT Chain is an innovative solution to bring programmability and interoperability to OCT Chain. OCT Chain relies on a system of PoA consensus that can support short block time and lower fees. The most bonded validator candidates of staking will become validators and produce blocks. The double-sign detection and other slashing logic guarantee security, stability, and chain finality.

Please read the [FAQ](./faq/nc/general.md) to get started.


## What can I do with OCT Chain?

The purpose of the new blockchain and DEX is to create an alternative marketplace for issuing and exchanging digital assets in a decentralized manner.

You can:

- Send and receive OCT
- Issue new tokens to digitalize assets, and use OCT Chain as underlying exchange/transfer
network for the assets



**For developers**, you can also:

OCT Chain, OCT boasts smart contract functionality and compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The design goal here was to leave the high throughput of OCT Chain intact while introducing smart contracts into its ecosystem.

Because OCT is EVM-compatible, it launched with support for the rich universe of [Ethereum](https://academy.scan.octium.io/en/articles/what-is-ethereum) tools and DApps. In theory, this makes it easy for developers to port their projects over from Ethereum. For users, it means that applications like [MetaMask](smart-chain/wallet/metamask.md) can be easily configured to work with TC. Seriously – it’s just a matter of tweaking a couple of settings. Check out Use MetaMask for OCT Chain to get started.

You can:

- Send and receive OCT
- Explore the transaction history and blocks on the chain, via [OCT SCAN](https://scan.octium.io), API
and node RPC interfaces.

**Developers** can also:

- [Issue](./smart-chain/developer/issue-OCT20.md) new tokens to digitalize assets
- Run a [full node](./smart-chain/developer/fullnode.md) to listen to and broadcast live updates on transactions, blocks, and consensus activities
- [Develop wallets](./smart-chain/wallet/wallet_api.md) and tools to help users use Dapps

## Get Started

Want to try it **OCT Chain**? Just give a peek at the first few of pages of the [getting started guide](get-started.md).<br/>
You could also have a read through the [FAQ](faq/faq.md).

Want to develop on **OCT Chain**? First, read through the [FAQ](faq/nc/general.md) and learn about tokens [here](smart-chain/developer/OCT20.md).

## Asset Management

### OCT20 Asset

A token protocol on OCT which is compatible with [ERC20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20). It extends ERC20 and contains more interfaces, such as `getOwner` and `decimals`. Read the full proposal here: <https://github.com/OCT/OCT-chain>

- [Issue OCT20](smart-chain/developer/issue-OCT20.md)
- [Wallet](smart-chain/wallet.md)

## OCT (and Other Coins) MainNet Switch

OCT Coin (OCT) was an ERC20 token on the Ethereum network.<br/>
After the launch of OCT Chain, OCT Coin (OCT) is being converted into native OCT tokens on the main network via the exchange platform at [scan.octium.io](https://www.scan.octium.io), a pragmatic and efficient way to perform the initial token swap.

OCT Chain is ready for other projects to migrate their tokens to take advantage of performant transactions with more liquidity options and native marketplace features.<br/>
More information about how projects can set themselves up for this (via [scan.octium.io](https://www.scan.octium.io) or partners) will come soon.
